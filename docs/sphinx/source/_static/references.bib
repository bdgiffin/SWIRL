abstract = {This paper presents a novel conceptual design framework which takes into account the direct wind loads and pressure loads acting on a structure due to the passing of a tornado. Furthermore, for the first time, the potential damage due to debris impact has been incorporated enabling a holistic assessment of structural loading to be considered. The model is built on a recently developed wind and pressure field model that captures the main features of tornadoes, which is used to generate a large number of tornado wind and pressure field realisations from which values of particular load effects can be determined. A cumulative distribution function of load effect is thus derived, which can be combined with tornado climatology probabilities to determine load effects at a particular risk level. This use of this framework is illustrated through two examples â€“ the direct wind and pressure loads on a low-rise portal frame structure, and the debris loads on a medium rise rectangular structure.}
