The primary vortex wind field model included within SWIRL is that proposed by :footcite:t:`baker_2018`. However, the structure of SWIRL is intended to facilitate the development and use of a variety of alternative vortex wind models or other general wind field types in the future. Support for coupling with CFD models through the `preCICE <https://precice.org>`_ coupling framework is also planned. SWIRL is currently under active development, and is seeking support from external collaborators. If you have an interest in using or contributing to the SWIRL project, please reach out to `Brian Doran Giffin <https://github.com/bdgiffin>`_ (`brian.giffin@okstate.edu <mailto:brian.giffin@okstate.edu>`_) for additional information.
